// writing clean code
// We used camelCase for variables and functions.
// All variable names start with a letter.
// We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
// We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
// Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
// Arrow function instead of function declaration
// Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
// No trailing comma in the last value of an object
// We prefer this +=, -=, *= /=, **= instead of the longer version
// When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
